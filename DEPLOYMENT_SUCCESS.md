# 🎉 AI Vibez - Deployment SUCCESS!

## ✅ Successfully Deployed
- **Live URL**: https://48b9b037.ai-vibez.pages.dev
- **Project**: ai-vibez 
- **Status**: ✅ Active and working

## 🔧 Root Cause & Fix
**Issue**: The Cloudflare Pages project "ai-vibez" didn't exist yet
**Solution**: Created the project first with `wrangler pages project create ai-vibez --production-branch=main`

The API token was working fine - we just needed to create the project before deploying to it.

## 🚀 Working Commands
```bash
# Full deployment (build + deploy)
npm run deploy:full

# Deploy only (if already built)  
npm run deploy

# Create new project (already done)
wrangler pages project create ai-vibez --production-branch=main
```
